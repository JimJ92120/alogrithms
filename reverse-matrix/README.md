## Description
Reverse a **square** like matrix (`3 x 3`, `4 x 4`, etc...) based on its **top-right** corner to its **bottom-left** corner.  

e.g:
- for a `3 x 3` matrix:
```
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]

=> output:
[9, 6, 3]
[8, 5, 2]
[7, 4, 1]
```
- for a `3 x 3` matrix:
```
[ 1,  2,  3,  4]
[ 5,  6,  7,  8]
[ 9, 10, 11, 12]
[13, 14, 15, 16]

=> output:
[16, 12,  8,  4]
[15, 11,  7,  3]
[14, 10,  6,  2]
[13,  9,  5,  1]
```
